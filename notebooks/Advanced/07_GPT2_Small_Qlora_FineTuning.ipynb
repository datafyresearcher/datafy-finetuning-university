Load and process data from the \"ecommerce-faq.json\" file, including printing the first question and dumping the data in a new file (\"dataset.json\").\n","3. Create a DataFrame from the questions key of the data.\n","4. Implement the GPT-2 language model and tokenizer, and count the number of trainable parameters in the model.\n","5. Enable gradient checkpointing for the model and prepare it for k-bit training.\n","6. Add the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptive) configuration to the model.\n","7. Add a prompt for creating an account.\n","8. Adjust the generation configurations for the model.\n","9. Enhance prompt generation with Torch's inference mode.\n","10. Build a HuggingFace model and dataset by loading the dataset from a JSON file, generating and tokenizing prompts for causal language modeling, shuffling and mapping train data for prompt generation and tokenization, and implementing a training loop for fine-tuning the GPT2 model on the custom dataset.\n","11. Load the TensorBoard extension and display the runs directory.\n","12. Save the pretrained GPT-2 model and push it to the Hugging Face Model Hub.\n","13. Update the PEFT model and tokenizer.\n","14. Update the generation configuration parameters for the model.\n","15. Add the ability to create an account through the chatbot interface.\n","16.
